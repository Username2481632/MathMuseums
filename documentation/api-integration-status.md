# API Integration Implementation Status

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the API integration implementation for the Math Museums project. The integration connects the frontend with the Django backend for authentication and data synchronization.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Authentication Client (auth.js)

- Created a client for managing authentication state
- Implemented automatic authentication checking on page load
- Added CSRF token handling for secure API requests
- Provided logout functionality

### 2. Synchronization Client (sync.js)

- Implemented a client for data synchronization between devices
- Added optimistic concurrency control with version tracking
- Created automatic background sync with retry mechanism
- Added manual sync button for user-initiated synchronization
- Implemented offline detection and sync queue
- Added visual sync status indicator

### 3. Preferences Client (preferences.js) 

- Created a client for managing user preferences
- Added server-side preference storage with local fallback
- Implemented theming support
- Modified onboarding to use the preferences client

### 4. Storage Enhancements

- Modified storage.js to track unsynced changes
- Added integration with server API for data persistence
- Implemented version tracking for conflict detection
- Added last sync timestamp tracking

### 5. UI Components

- Added sync status indicator showing current sync state
- Implemented manual sync button for user-initiated sync
- Enhanced styling for better user feedback

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:8000/ in a browser
   - You should be redirected to the login page if not authenticated

3. Authentication Flow:
   - Log in with an email address
   - Enter the OTP code (check the console for the code in development)
   - You should be redirected to the main application

4. Concept Management:
   - Create or modify a concept tile
   - Verify sync status indicator appears and shows "Syncing..." then "All changes saved"

5. Offline Testing:
   - Disable network connection (using browser DevTools)
   - Make changes to concept tiles
   - Sync status should show "You are offline"
   - Re-enable network
   - Use the "Sync Now" button or wait for automatic sync
   - Changes should synchronize to the server

6. Multi-device Testing:
   - Log in on a second device or browser
   - Make changes on one device
   - Sync both devices
   - Verify changes appear on both devices

## Known Issues

- No robust conflict resolution UI yet (server uses newest-wins strategy)
- Manual intervention may be needed for complex conflicts
- Some browsers may limit background sync in inactive tabs

## Next Steps

1. Enhance conflict resolution UI
2. Add more detailed sync status reporting
3. Implement more robust error handling
4. Add unit tests for synchronization
