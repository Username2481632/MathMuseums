# Progress

## Completed

### Core Application Development
- Project requirements clarification (desktop-first, clean design, hash-based routing)
- Project file structure creation
- HTML scaffold with templates for all views
- CSS styling with clean, minimalist design
- Storage implementation (IndexedDB + localStorage fallback)
- Router implementation for hash-based navigation
- Model layer for concept data
- Home controller with draggable tile grid
- Detail controller with Desmos integration
- Onboarding flow functionality
- Desmos preview image generation and extraction
- Proper resource management between view transitions

### UI/UX Improvements
- Resizable tiles with corner dragging functionality
- Improved boundary constraints for resizing operations
- Enhanced prevention of navigational clicks during resize operations
- Fixed inconsistency between boundary limits for resizing and repositioning
- Maximized available space for the home page by removing padding and margins
- Enhanced visual feedback during user interactions (blue highlight during dragging)
- Implemented view-specific styling to maintain detail view margins while maximizing home view space

### Django Backend Integration
- Set up Django project structure (Step 1 of HelioHost integration plan)
- Configured Django settings and URL routing
- Created template structure with proper static files handling
- Set up environment variables for secure configuration
- Created WSGI configuration for HelioHost deployment
- Set up PostgreSQL database for server-side storage (Step 2)
- Configured Django to use PostgreSQL with environment variables
- Set up local development database using Podman
- Migrated database schema to PostgreSQL
- Documented database configuration

### Authentication System
- Created OTP-based authentication views and templates
- Deployed basic application with functional frontend
- Implemented login requirement for the main application (Step 3)
- Added login_required decorator to index view
- Configured proper login/logout redirects
- Enhanced authentication templates with better styling
- Added debugging middleware for authentication troubleshooting
- Added /api/auth/status/ endpoint for lightweight authentication checks (May 20, 2025)
- Updated frontend AuthClient to use new endpoint, eliminating 403 errors from /api/concepts/
- Verified login flow and authentication status detection now work without polluting logs
- Fixed authentication system with improved error handling for production environment
- Implemented comprehensive logging for troubleshooting authentication issues 
- Created deployment script for the authentication fix

### Email Backend Configuration
- Removed Sendmail backend and switched to SMTP for outgoing email due to DKIM issues
- Production email now uses Django's SMTP backend (requires EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_USE_SSL in .env)
- Logging and error handling for email sending fully updated and verified on HelioHost

### SMTP Troubleshooting (May 27, 2025)
- Investigated SMTP authentication failures on HelioHost production environment
- Created comprehensive SMTP test scripts: app.py, heliohost_app.py, test_on_heliohost.py
- Verified email account configuration in Plesk control panel
- Tested network connectivity to mail server (sr308.hostgator.com:587)
- Confirmed SMTP authentication credentials are correctly configured
- Documented authentication error patterns and server responses
- Restored project files from old_proj.bak/ directory to main location
- **RESOLVED**: Issue was unchecked mailbox checkbox in Plesk email configuration
- **Root Cause**: Without mailbox enabled, account exists for Plesk login but not mail authentication
- **Solution**: Enabled mailbox checkbox - SMTP authentication now works properly
- **Credit**: Issue resolved with help from Krydos (HelioHost support) via Discord troubleshooting

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed: Application allowing access without authentication
- Fixed: Onboarding flow not working correctly with scrolled content or finding Desmos UI elements
- Fixed: Desmos API updated from v1.7 to v1.10 with required API key
- Fixed: Second step of onboarding flow failing to detect image menu items in Desmos v1.10
- Fixed: Improved onboarding element animations and visual feedback
- Fixed: Image upload stuck at "Uploading image..." by letting Desmos handle uploads natively
- Fixed: Onboarding flow repeatedly appearing during the same session
- Fixed: Navigation issues with memory leaks when switching between views
- Fixed: Resize operations sometimes triggering navigation to detail view
- Fixed: Tiles could be resized outside the container boundaries
- Fixed: Inconsistent boundary limits between resize and drag operations

### Critical Security Fix (May 27, 2025)
- **IDENTIFIED**: Critical security vulnerability where entire application was exposed to unauthenticated users
- **Problem**: Application loaded all frontend code, templates, and resources before checking authentication
- **Impact**: Unauthorized users could access complete application logic, API endpoints, and business logic
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Authentication-first loading architecture
  - Modified URL routing to implement two-step authentication flow
  - Created minimal `auth_check.html` template that only loads authentication scripts
  - Added `@login_required` decorator to protect main application access
  - Implemented protected static file serving for JavaScript and CSS files
  - Route `/` now serves auth check page, `/app/` serves authenticated application
  - JavaScript/CSS files now require authentication, images remain public
  - Updated authentication views to redirect to new auth check flow
- **TESTING COMPLETED**: Verified no resources are exposed to unauthenticated users
- **STATUS**: Security vulnerability fully resolved

### Deployment and Cleanup
- Bundled Django REST Framework and dependencies as .whl files in staticlibs for deployment without shell access
- Updated dispatch.wsgi to load .whl files from staticlibs
- Removed all custom Django code and wheels from staticlibs
- Updated dispatch.wsgi to remove staticlibs/django references and ensure only pip/system Django is used
- Moved ALLOWED_HOSTS to .env and updated settings.py to use env.list('ALLOWED_HOSTS')
- Committed and pushed all changes for HelioHost deployment
- Investigated and resolved missing rest_framework error on HelioHost
- Cleaned up unnecessary files in the project (cleanup.sh)
- Memory Bank documentation setup and maintenance

## Current Issues

### Historical Issues (Resolved)
- **PostgreSQL Version Compatibility**: Previously blocked by Django 5.0.7 requiring PostgreSQL 14+ while HelioHost provided PostgreSQL 13.20
  - Various workarounds attempted (monkeypatching, custom backends)
  - Issue was resolved through alternative deployment approaches

### Active Issues
- **None currently identified** - All major blocking issues have been resolved
- Email functionality now working properly
- Django application ready for production deployment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Deploy Complete Application**: Email functionality now working - ready for full production deployment
2. **Production Testing**: Test end-to-end authentication flow with working email verification
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify all application functionality in production environment

### Future Development
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error reporting for production environment
2. **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries and frontend performance
3. **User Experience**: Continue refining UI/UX based on user feedback
4. **Feature Expansion**: Implement additional math concept categories and interactive features

## Known Technical Debt
- Frontend could benefit from better state management patterns
- Database queries could be optimized for larger datasets
- Error handling could be more granular in production environment
- Test coverage could be expanded for authentication flows
