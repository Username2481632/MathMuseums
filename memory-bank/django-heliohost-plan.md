# Django Integration and HelioHost Deployment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the atomic steps required to migrate the Math Museums project from a client-side only application to a full-stack application hosted on HelioHost with Django, supporting cross-device synchronization through user accounts.

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure
**Goal:** Create a Django project structure that integrates with the existing frontend.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create a Django project structure
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
3. Configure Django settings
4. Create directory structure for Django apps
5. Configure static file serving for existing frontend files
6. Set up URL routing
7. Configure WSGI for HelioHost deployment

### Test Criteria:
- Django development server can run locally
- Existing frontend is accessible through Django's static file serving
- Basic URL routing works

### Git Commit Message:
"Set up Django project structure with existing frontend integration"

## Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database
**Goal:** Configure PostgreSQL database for server-side storage.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create PostgreSQL database in local environment
2. Configure Django database settings for both local development and HelioHost
3. Create initial database migration
4. Test database connection
5. Document database connection details for HelioHost

### Test Criteria:
- Successful database connection locally
- Migrations apply correctly
- Django admin interface is accessible

### Git Commit Message:
"Configure PostgreSQL database integration with Django"

## Step 3: Implement User Authentication System
**Goal:** Create a user authentication system using email OTP.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create authentication app in Django
2. Extend Django User model or create custom user model with email as primary field
3. Implement email OTP generation and verification
4. Create shared login/signup view that determines action based on email existence
5. Implement OTP verification view
6. Create authentication API endpoints
7. Set up email sending functionality

### Test Criteria:
- User registration works with OTP verification
- Login works with OTP verification
- Password reset functionality works
- Authentication endpoints return appropriate responses
- Email sending functions properly

### Git Commit Message:
"Implement email OTP authentication system with shared login/signup interface"

## Step 4: Define Database Models for User Data
**Goal:** Create database models to store user data and concept information.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create models for user profile information
2. Create models for concept data (tiles, positions, Desmos state)
3. Create model for user preferences
4. Define relationships between models
5. Set up serializers for API responses
6. Create database migrations

### Test Criteria:
- Models properly store all necessary data
- Migrations apply successfully
- Model validation works correctly
- Admin interface can manage model instances

### Git Commit Message:
"Create database models for user data and concept information"

## Step 5: Develop REST API Endpoints
**Goal:** Create REST API endpoints for data synchronization between client and server.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create API app in Django
2. Set up Django REST Framework
3. Implement endpoints for user profile
4. Implement endpoints for concept data CRUD operations
5. Implement endpoints for synchronization
6. Add authentication to API endpoints
7. Implement request validation
8. Create tests for API endpoints

### Test Criteria:
- All endpoints return correct data
- Authentication works properly
- CRUD operations function as expected
- Endpoints handle synchronization edge cases
- Tests pass

### Git Commit Message:
"Implement REST API endpoints for data synchronization"

## Step 6: Modify Frontend for API Integration
**Goal:** Update the existing frontend to use the Django backend for storage.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Create API client in JavaScript
2. Modify storage utility to use server when available, falling back to IndexedDB
3. Add authentication UI components
4. Implement synchronization logic
5. Update controllers to handle server communication
6. Implement offline detection and queue for operations
7. Add visual indicators for sync status

### Test Criteria:
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
- Data syncs correctly between devices
- Offline functionality continues to work
- UI provides appropriate feedback about sync status
- Conflict resolution works properly

### Git Commit Message:
"Update frontend to integrate with Django backend and support synchronization"

## Step 7: Test and Deploy to HelioHost
**Goal:** Test the full application and deploy it to HelioHost.

### Implementation Tasks:
1. Set up HelioHost account and domain
2. Create PostgreSQL database on HelioHost
3. Configure Django settings for production
4. Set up WSGI configuration
5. Deploy Django project to HelioHost
6. Request WSGI Control Access
7. Test all functionality in production environment
8. Document deployment process

### Test Criteria:
- Application successfully deploys to HelioHost
- All features work in production environment
- Database connections function properly
- Static files serve correctly
- Performance is acceptable

### Git Commit Message:
"Deploy Math Museums to HelioHost with full synchronization support"

## Additional Notes
- Each step should be completed, tested, and committed before proceeding to the next
- Local development should be done with Django's development server
- Database migrations should be committed with code changes
- Secrets (API keys, etc.) should be stored in environment variables, not in code
- Regular backups of the database should be established once in production
